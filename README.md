# Semantic-Segmentation-using-DeepLabV3-and-Resnet-101


This project focuses on developing a semantic segmentation model for the objects (Socket and 
Noticeboard) from dataset. Semantic segmentation is a computer vision task that involves 
partitioning an image into meaningful segments and assigning a class label to each pixel. This 
report details the initial phases of the project, specifically covering dataset acquisition, 
comprehensive data preprocessing, and partitioning strategies, which are crucial foundational 
steps for any robust machine learning pipeline. 
The objective of this project is to establish a solid data pipeline, ensuring the dataset is 
correctly loaded, inspected, and prepared for subsequent model training. This includes 
consolidating various dataset splits, visualizing image-mask pairs, and applying appropriate 
transformations for neural network compatibility.
